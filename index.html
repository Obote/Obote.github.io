        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
          It is a small and lightweight language. 
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected 
          to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
          and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.

          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
        </p>
        <p>
          A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). 
        </p>

        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a 
          runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: 
        </p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
        </code>
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways: 
        </p>
        <code>
          var x = 42
        </code>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, 
        </p>
        <code>
          x = 42
        </code>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,
        </p>
        <code>
          let y = 13
        </code>
        <p>
          You can also have constant "variables"
        </p>
        <code>
          const z = 42
        </code>
