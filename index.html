    Hello Camper!

    For now, the test suite only works in Chrome!
    Please read the README below in the JS Editor before beginning.
    Feel free to delete this message once you have read it.

        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
          It is a small and lightweight language. 
          Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected 
          to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
          and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a 
            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant 
            to running JavaScript on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>

          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). 
          </li>
          <li>
            Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
          </li>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, 
            try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="javascript_and_java" class="main-section">
        <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
          The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a 
          runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. 
          You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="hello_world" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: 
        </p>
        <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
        </code>
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! 
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="declaring_variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways: 
        </p>
        <code>
          var x = 42
        </code>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, 
        </p>
        <code>
          x = 42
        </code>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,
        </p>
        <code>
          let y = 13
        </code>
        <p>
          You can also have constant "variables"
        </p>
        <code>
          const z = 42
        </code>
